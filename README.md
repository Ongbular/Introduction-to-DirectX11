# Introduction to DirectX11

![img](http://d3dcoder.net/Images/bookcover4.jpg)

- This is a unofficial repository for Frank D. Luna's book [Introduction to 3D Game Programming using DirectX11](http://d3dcoder.net/d3d11.htm).

---

## Motivation

- The book has been published for a long time and much of the much of the officially provided source code is deprecated.
- At the time this project was initialized (January 2023), much of the provided source code is difficult to run on version 10 or later of the Windows platform.
- This project has been modified in several places to run on Windows operating systems from version 10 onwards and by the Visual Studio 2019 community.

- The copyright of the modified source code in this repository is still attributed to Frank D.Luna.
- The copyright policy for the newly created source code follows the MIT license policy.
